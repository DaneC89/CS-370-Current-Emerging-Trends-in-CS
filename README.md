    What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
    
    Computer scientits find solutions to real world problems by way of computer technology.
    This can consist of programming machines to perform tasks, or development of applications
    that serve the end user in an impactful way. 
    
    How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
    
    As a computer scientist I first like to understand what the end goal for a user would
    be when looking at a specific problem. I want to find the best possible solution that 
    can make the user experiance memerable. Additionally, I want to make sure that I am
    not introducing any new issues when finding a solution to one problem. This helps me to ensure 
    that the user is not negativly impacted by my solution to their original problem. I want
    to keep the users best interest at heart. I want to find out what the user is looking for 
    in a solution to better understand who will be using this 'fix'.
    
    What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
    
    Ultimatly, protection of the user and organization are key. Nothing is more important than
    the safty of the users. Protection of personal data, and physical health should be the main
    priority for any possible solution to a given problem. To protect organizations, safegaurds must
    be in place to protect the data of their users. This could mean ensureing the proper encryption is used
    to protect all data that may be stored. Organizations must adhear to guidlines set for to maintain
    transparency as well as protection. Users need to be away of how their data is going to be used and
    stored by the organization. This could be done in many ways, but overall, the user cannot be kept
    in the dark about thier information. This helps to keep the organization in a trustworthy light with
    the end user.
